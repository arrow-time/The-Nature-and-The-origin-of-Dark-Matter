# The Nature and The origin of Dark Matter

How does Dark Matter form? What is the Nature of Dark Matter? 

In essence, dark matter is also a form of locked spatial compression state, but with a much lower compression strength compared to mass states. 

Dark matter formation is also dominated by a synergistic locking mechanism involving spatial compression states and a Higgs-like mechanism (space network spinor and SEQ fixed-chirality spin coupling), similar to the mass generation mechanism in the early stages of cosmic expansion. However, dark matter formed at a later stage than ordinary mass. The spatial compression level during this phase was insufficient to reach the threshold required for mass generation. Moreover, by this time, the increase in entropy had led to a more uniform distribution of space network spinor, reducing the strength of the spinor field in the Higgs-like mechanism to a level insufficient to lock high-compression states. This is the fundamental difference between dark matter and mass states. In essence, dark matter is also a form of locked spatial compression state, but with a much lower compression strength compared to mass states. Nevertheless, it still exerts a stretching effect on the surrounding space, manifesting as a gravitational field.

Why is there a global gravitational tension-restoring potential in the first stage of cosmic expansion, even though the entire space is in a compressed phase? Because the compression level within mass structures is significantly higher than that of the surrounding space, leading to a large gradient in spatial deformation, which gives rise to a relative tension-restoring potential â€” the gravitational potential.
